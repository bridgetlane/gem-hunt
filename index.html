<h2>Gem Hunt</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Play as an reluctant participant collecting gems. He has to be persuaded, because he is a reluctant participant.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player experience should be unpredictable because of the lava, and cause the player to take note of what they are doing.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual games.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players can use L/R/U/D arrow keys to navigate the maze and collect all eight gems on the map.
<br><br>If you hit lava, the lava will expand on the map and your player will become more disgruntled.
<br><br>If you hit water, your player will drink the water and you will gain persuasion.
<br>
System dynamics: The lava expands on hit.<br>
Core mechanic: You can collect gems.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype explores careful controls.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My game is unique because if you hit the lava you will most likely fail.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are trying to collect all the gems, but you are playing as a reluctant participant (he does not want to help you). Therefore he easily becomes disgruntled.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game does not have an storyline.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
3 minutes.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keep an eye on persuasion.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The tilemap was created by me using Tiled.
<br><br>The tilesheet and sprite are from the Platformer Art Deluxe pack, an uncopyrighted tileset that can be found here http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-deluxe

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not model this game or take the game framework from any existing game or Phaser example. I did use Phaser documentation and many examples for many small parts of the game, such as learning how to set keypad controls.
